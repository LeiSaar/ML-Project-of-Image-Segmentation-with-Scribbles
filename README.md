## Image Segmentation from Scribble Annotations

This project focuses on foreground-background segmentation in natural images using sparse scribble annotations (user-drawn scribbles roughly indicating foreground and background regions). The goal is to develop models that leverage these partial annotations to generate accurate, full-resolution binary segmentation masks.

Multiple approaches will be explored, and the best-performing model will be optimized and applied to the task.
